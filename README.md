# 📝 Usage

> [!NOTE]
>  - Supported image types: `.png` `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.jfif` `.jpg_large` `.webp` `.bmp`

This tool is designed to be used with AI-generated images in the pixel art style. It's common for these images to be generated with *mushed* colors and/or sloppy pixel shaping. Processing those images with this tool can enhance the pixel art style, and improve image quality.
